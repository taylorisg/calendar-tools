# Calendar Tools

Automatically block focus time and lunch on your Google Calendar — a self-hosted alternative to Clockwise.

Checks your existing events, finds free slots, and creates blocks in a dedicated "Blocked Time" calendar so colleagues see you as busy without exposing the names of your private events.

## How it works

- Creates a separate **Blocked Time** calendar in your Google account
- Queries your real calendar for busy time before scheduling anything
- Schedules **🍝 Lunch** in the first available gap in your lunch window
- Schedules **🤓 Focus Time** to hit a weekly hour target, preferring afternoons
- Adds **☕ Meeting Breaks** after long stretches of back-to-back meetings
- Supports **Custom Categories** — define your own blocks with custom scheduling logic
- Syncs your **Slack status** automatically based on what's on your calendar
- Respects tentative events for focus time, but lunch can go over them
- Prorates focus time automatically if you run it mid-week
- Optionally uses OpenAI to explain missed blocks and suggest which specific meetings to move

## Requirements

- A Mac (these instructions are Mac-specific)
- A Google account
- Node.js 18 or higher

**Check if Node.js is installed:**
```bash
node --version
```
If you get "command not found", download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then come back.

## Setup

### 1. Get the code

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone <repo-url>
cd calendar-tools
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Fix macOS quarantine

macOS blocks executables downloaded from the internet. Run this one-time fix or the app won't start:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine node_modules/@esbuild/darwin-arm64/bin/esbuild
```

### 4. Get Google OAuth credentials

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a new project (name it anything)
2. Use the search bar to find **Google Calendar API** and click **Enable**
3. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
4. Choose **Web application**
5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **Add URI** and enter: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
6. Click **Create** — copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 5. Configure your environment

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in any text editor and fill in your credentials:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=paste_your_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=paste_your_client_secret_here

# Optional: enables AI suggestions for missed blocks
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Optional: enables Slack status sync
SLACK_USER_TOKEN=your_slack_user_token_here
```

### 6. Connect your Google account

```bash
npm run server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and click **Connect Google**. Sign in and approve access. Once connected, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

### 7. Schedule it to run every Monday automatically

```bash
npm run schedule:install
```

### 8. Test it

Preview what would be created without touching your calendar:

```bash
npm run block-time:dry-run
```

If it lists blocks, everything is working. Create them for real:

```bash
npm run block-time
```

### 9. Make your blocks visible to colleagues

The app creates events in a separate **Blocked Time** calendar. By default this calendar is private, so colleagues won't see you as busy. To fix that:

1. In Google Calendar, find **Blocked Time** in the left sidebar
2. Click the three dots next to it → **Settings and sharing**
3. Under **Access permissions for events**, enable **"Make available for [your org]"**
4. Set the permission to **"See only free/busy (hide details)"**

Colleagues will now see you as busy during your blocks without seeing the event names.

## Usage

### Web UI

```bash
npm run server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — configure your schedule, preview blocks, and create or refresh them all from the browser.

### CLI

```bash
# Preview what would be created (reads your real calendar, creates nothing)
npm run block-time:dry-run

# Create blocks for the next 14 days (skips ones that already exist)
npm run block-time

# Wipe and recreate all blocks — use after your calendar changes significantly
npm run block-time:refresh
```

---

## Configuration

All settings are available in the web UI. To configure via file, create `block-time-config.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "days": 14,
  "weekdaysOnly": true,
  "workDayStart": "08:00",
  "workDayEnd": "17:00",
  "lunch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "windowStart": "11:00",
    "windowEnd": "12:30",
    "minMinutes": 30,
    "maxMinutes": 60
  },
  "focusTime": {
    "enabled": true,
    "weeklyTargetHours": 8,
    "minBlockMinutes": 60,
    "maxBlockMinutes": 180,
    "maxDailyFocusHours": 3,
    "preferAfterTime": "11:00"
  },
  "meetingBreak": {
    "enabled": true,
    "thresholdHours": 2,
    "durationMinutes": 15,
    "gapToleranceMinutes": 5
  },
  "aiInstructions": "Never suggest moving Weekly All-Hands."
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `days` | How many days ahead to schedule |
| `weekdaysOnly` | Skip weekends |
| `workDayStart` / `workDayEnd` | Focus blocks won't go outside these hours |
| `lunch.enabled` | Whether to schedule lunch blocks at all |
| `lunch.windowStart` / `windowEnd` | Earliest start and latest end for lunch |
| `lunch.minMinutes` | Skip lunch if less than this is free in the window |
| `lunch.maxMinutes` | Cap lunch at this length |
| `focusTime.enabled` | Whether to schedule focus time at all |
| `focusTime.weeklyTargetHours` | Hours of focus to schedule per week |
| `focusTime.minBlockMinutes` | Don't create a focus block shorter than this |
| `focusTime.maxBlockMinutes` | Cap any single focus block at this length |
| `focusTime.maxDailyFocusHours` | Cap total focus time across all blocks in a single day |
| `focusTime.preferAfterTime` | Try afternoon slots first, fall back to morning |
| `meetingBreak.enabled` | Whether to insert breaks after long meeting runs |
| `meetingBreak.thresholdHours` | Insert a break after this many consecutive hours of meetings |
| `meetingBreak.durationMinutes` | Length of the break |
| `meetingBreak.gapToleranceMinutes` | Meetings within this gap count as consecutive |
| `aiInstructions` | Extra context for the AI suggestions (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`) |

---

## Custom Categories

Beyond the built-in Lunch, Focus Time, and Meeting Break categories, you can define your own blocks in the web UI under **Custom Categories**.

Each custom category has a name, emoji, and one of three scheduling types:

| Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Fixed block** | Always scheduled at a set time — immovable, placed before other blocks |
| **Lunch-style** | Finds the first free slot within a configurable time window each day |
| **Focus-style** | Fills a weekly hours target across the best available slots |

You can optionally set a **Slack status text and emoji** per category (see Slack Status Sync below).

**Example — a daily morning workout:**
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "Workout",
  "emoji": "🏋️",
  "type": "fixed",
  "enabled": true,
  "fixedTime": "07:00",
  "fixedDurationMinutes": 45,
  "fixedDays": "weekdays",
  "slackStatusText": "At the gym",
  "slackStatusEmoji": ":muscle:"
}
```

Custom categories are managed through the web UI and saved to `block-time-config.json` automatically.

## Slack Status Sync

Automatically sets your Slack status based on what's happening on your calendar right now.

| Calendar event | Slack status |
|---|---|
| Any confirmed meeting | 🗓️ In a meeting |
| 🤓 Focus Time block | 🎧 Focusing |
| 🍝 Lunch block | 🍴 Out for lunch |
| ☕ Meeting Break block | ☕ Taking a break |
| Custom category (with status set) | Your custom text + emoji |
| Nothing | Status cleared |

### Setup

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App → From scratch**
2. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** → under **Redirect URLs** add `https://localhost`, then save
3. Under **User Token Scopes** add `users.profile:write`
4. Go to **Settings → Basic Information** → **Install to Workspace** → install and copy the **User OAuth Token** (`xoxp-...`)
5. Add it to your `.env`:
   ```env
   SLACK_USER_TOKEN=xoxp-your-token-here
   ```

### Run manually

```bash
npm run slack-sync
```

### Install as a background job (runs every minute)

```bash
npm run slack-sync:schedule:install
```

To uninstall:
```bash
npm run slack-sync:schedule:uninstall
```

## Other files in this repo

This repo also contains some personal tooling for [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com) (a task manager) that isn't part of the calendar blocking feature:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `index.js` / `tasks.json` | Bulk-creates Motion tasks from a JSON file |
| `src/cliMotionNotes.ts` | Converts freeform notes into Motion tasks via OpenAI |
| `pull-open-tasks.js` | Dumps open Motion tasks to markdown for LLM prioritization |
| `fetch-projects.js` | Lists/searches Motion projects by name |

These require a `MOTION_API_KEY` and `MOTION_WORKSPACE_ID` in your `.env`. They're independent of the calendar tools and can be ignored if you're only here for the focus blocking.
