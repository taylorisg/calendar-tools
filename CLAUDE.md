# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
npm run build                   # Compile TypeScript → dist/

# Calendar blocking (primary feature)
npm run block-time              # Create blocks for next 14 days (skips existing)
npm run block-time:dry-run      # Preview without creating
npm run block-time:refresh      # Delete and recreate all blocks
npm run block-time:setup-auth   # One-time Google OAuth setup
npm run block-time -- --list-calendars  # Print all calendar names (useful for personalMirror config)

# Web UI
npm run server                  # Start UI at http://localhost:3000

# macOS scheduling
npm run schedule:install          # Install launchd job (reads refreshSchedule from config, defaults to weekly)
npm run schedule:uninstall        # Remove launchd job

# Motion tooling (secondary)
npm run motion-notes -- "text"  # Convert notes to Motion tasks
npm run fetch-projects          # List Motion projects
npm run pull-open-tasks         # Export open tasks to markdown
```

## Architecture

This is a **Google Calendar automation tool** (Clockwise replacement) that schedules focus time and lunch blocks. Two interfaces: CLI (`cliBlockTime.ts`) and Express web UI (`server.ts`).

### Primary flow

1. **Auth**: OAuth2 via `googleCalendar.ts` — saves refresh token to `.env`
2. **Config**: Loaded from `block-time-config.json` (auto-detected by CLI and web UI) or hardcoded defaults in `scheduler.ts`
3. **Busy query**: `googleCalendar.ts:queryBusyIntervals()` returns two sets — confirmed-only and confirmed+tentative — from all user calendars
4. **Scheduling** (`scheduler.ts:scheduleBlocks()`):
   - Lunch: first gap in window; respects confirmed events only (tentative don't block lunch)
   - Focus blocks: prefers afternoon (`preferAfterTime`), falls back to morning; capped at `maxBlockMinutes`
   - Meeting breaks: 15-min gaps after 2+ consecutive hours of meetings
   - Focus target is prorated for partial weeks
5. **AI enrichment** (optional): `suggestions.ts` calls GPT-4o-mini if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set — explains missed lunch and suggests alternatives for focus shortfalls
6. **Event creation**: Creates events in a dedicated "Blocked Time" calendar; skips duplicates by matching `summary + start time`

### Key files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/scheduler.ts` | Core algorithm — free interval detection, lunch/focus/break scheduling, proration |
| `src/googleCalendar.ts` | Google Calendar API — OAuth, event CRUD, busy intervals |
| `src/cliBlockTime.ts` | CLI entry point — wires auth → schedule → create |
| `src/server.ts` | Web server — OAuth callback, config API, `/api/run` endpoint |
| `src/suggestions.ts` | GPT integration for schedule report enrichment |

### Personal calendar mirroring

If `personalMirror` is configured in `block-time-config.json`, the app reads timed events from a linked personal Google Calendar and creates matching private **"Busy"** blocks on the **primary work calendar** — so colleagues see the time is taken without seeing event details. Mirrors Clockwise's cross-calendar blocking behaviour.

- Blocks land on the primary work calendar (not "Blocked Time"), making them visible and impossible to miss
- All-day events are skipped; only timed events overlapping work hours on weekdays are mirrored
- Looks ahead `lookAheadDays` (default: 30) rather than the standard `config.days` window
- Works with linked Gmail accounts that have free/busy-only access (event titles are not required)
- Duplicate detection prevents re-creating blocks on subsequent runs

```json
"personalMirror": {
  "enabled": true,
  "calendarNames": ["personal@gmail.com"],
  "lookAheadDays": 30
}
```

Use `--list-calendars` to find the exact calendar name to use.

### Refresh schedule

Set `refreshSchedule` in `block-time-config.json` to control how often `npm run schedule:install` schedules the launchd job:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `"weekly"` | Every Monday at 8am (default) |
| `"daily"` | Every day at 8am |
| `"hourly"` | Every hour — keeps blocks in sync as meetings shift around |

```json
"refreshSchedule": "hourly"
```

Run `npm run schedule:install` after changing this to apply the new schedule.

### Secondary feature: Motion task tooling

`src/motionNotesAgent.ts` uses GPT-4o-mini to parse freeform notes into structured tasks, then fuzzy-matches them to Motion projects (`src/motionProjects.ts`) and creates them via `src/motionClient.ts` (rate-limited to 12 req/min).

## Environment variables

Required for calendar blocking:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — from Google Cloud Console
- `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` — auto-set by `setup-auth`

Optional:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — enables AI suggestions
- `MOTION_API_KEY`, `MOTION_WORKSPACE_ID` — for Motion task features
- `TRIAGE_PROJECT_ID`, `DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`, `CLOCKWISE_PROJECT_NAME` — Motion routing
- `DEBUG=true` — verbose logging

## Calendar event conventions

Blocked events are created with `transparency: "opaque"` (shows as busy), `visibility: "public"` (colleagues see event names, not details), in a calendar named "Blocked Time" separate from the user's primary calendar.

Personal mirror blocks are created with `visibility: "private"` directly on the primary calendar — colleagues see "Busy" with no details.
